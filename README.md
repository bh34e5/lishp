# Lishp (Lisp-ish)

## Description

An attempt at slowly building up a CommonLisp interpreter/compiler. Partially
just to say that I did, and partially so that when it gets to a certain level of
completeness (which is probably a ways away), I can try a couple different
things and see what it does to the language.
